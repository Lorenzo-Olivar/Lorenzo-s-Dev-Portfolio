            <h4>ABOUT ME</h4>
            <p>Hey! My name is Lorenzo Olivar, but I usually go by Zo. <br>
                Before I was a student at UC Berkeley, I attended the Diablo Valley Community College in California. 
                There, I graduated with my Associate's Degree in the Spring of 2023. 
                During my Associate's program at DVC, I gained new experiences and valuable life lessons as I worked full-time to pay for college. 
                As I evolve as an individual and as a developer, I plan to fine-tune my skills, honing in on a unique skillset or specialty that I can advertise and offer my clients in the future.
