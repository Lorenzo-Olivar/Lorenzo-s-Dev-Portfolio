            <h4>ABOUT ME</h4>
            <p>Hi! My name is Lorenzo Olivar, but I usually go by Zo. <br>
                Before I was a student at UC Berkeley, I attended the Diablo Valley Community College in California where I graduated with my Associates Degree in Spring of 2023. During my Associates program at DVC, I worked full-time to pay for college gaining new experiences along the way as well as valuable life lessons. <br>
                As I evolve as an individual and as a developer, I hope to fine tune and hone in on a unique skillset or specialty that I can advertise and offer my clients in the future.
