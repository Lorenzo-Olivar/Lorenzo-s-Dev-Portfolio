# Lorenzo-s-Dev-Portfolio

## Description

My motivation for making a portfolio webpage is to show my growth as a new developer to the community of developers and future employers. I want my portfolio to showcase my knowledge and the rate to pick up a new skill or trend within the dev community and workplace. I want to tell a story about my passion and willingness to achieve new heights as a developer and for my future workplace peers to be confident in my developer and team player abilities.
