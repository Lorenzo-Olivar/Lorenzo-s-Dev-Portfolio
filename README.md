# Lorenzo-s-Dev-Portfolio

## Description

My motivation for making a portfolio webpage is to show my growth as a new developer towards the commutity of developers and future employers. I want my portfolio to showcase my knowledge as well as the rate that I can pick up a new skill or trend within the dev community and workplace. I want to tell a story about my passion and willingness to achieve new heights as a developer and for my future workplace peers to be confident in my abilities both as a developer and a team player. 

## Usage

This simplistic webpage features buttons linked to projects and socials and text explaining who I am and what I hope to achieve.
