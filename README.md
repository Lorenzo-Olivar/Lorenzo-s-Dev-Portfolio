# Lorenzo-s-Dev-Portfolio

## Description

My motivation for making a portfolio webpage is to show my growth as a new developer towards the commutity of developers and future employers. I want my portfolio to showcase my knowledge as well as the rate that I can pick up a new skill or trend within the dev community and workplace. I want to tell a story about my passion and willingness to achieve new heights as a developer and for my future workplace peers to be confident in my abilities both as a developer and a team player. 

## Usage (to be updated)

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
